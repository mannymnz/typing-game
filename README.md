Typing Game Website based on Monkeytype.com

Tech Stack: 
Frontend: Raw CSS/HTML/JavaScript
Backend: Python/Flask

This project was created in my process of learning CSS/HTML/JS for the first time. Creating a dynamic website using the above the tech stack allowed me to develop a strong understanding of raw CSS/HTML/JS, making the transition to React and other Frontend/Backend frameworks better.
